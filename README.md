## Features

- Encrypt plain text with chosen cipher
- Decrypt ciphertext written in one of the classical ciphers
- Break Ceasar Cipher ciphertexts
- Generate pair of keys for RSA  algorithm
- Encrypt and decrypt RSA 
- Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme presantation 
- Generate secret sharing keys

## Information 

Simple Cryptography was written in Python 3.10 by Kacper Bojanowski and Filip Opiłka
Main libraries are: [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), [Cryptodome](https://www.pycryptodome.org/en/latest/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Literature 

It is commonly known that [Google](google.com) is the best friend of a programmer, but here are some website to help 
you with understanding topics mantioned in our presentation:

- [Ceasar Cipher](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/caesar-cipher-in-cryptography/)
- [Playfair Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher)
- [Vigenere Cipher](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/vigenere-cipher)
- [RSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf1z7GlG6Qo&ab_channel=Simplilearn)
- [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://apogiatzis.medium.com/shamirs-secret-sharing-a-numeric-example-walkthrough-a59b288c34c4)

## Tasks

In this repository in directory `Tasks` we made for you some exercises for you to practise programming skills 
The instructions to tasks is also in this directory

*Good luck!*
