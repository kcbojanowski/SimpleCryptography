# **Tasks**

## Practical part of Simple Cryptography presentation
There are three tasks waiting for you. 

### Task no. 1 - Classical ciphers
File: `Task_1.py`

Write a code that will encrypt plaintext in Vigenere Cipher. As a parameters to the function use plaintext and key previously prepared by function generate_key().  Try to avoid using the Internet.

### Task no. 2 - RSA
File: `Task_2.py`

In function `key_pair()` write a code that will allow you to save pair of keys:
public and private it format of `public_key_[Year][Month][Hour][Minute][Second].pem`.
To do that use library **Cryptodome**. 

To download it go to *Python Packages* and install *pycryptodomex* or use command `pip install pycryptodomex`.

### Task no. 3 - Sockets
